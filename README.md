gokinesis
=========
A Golang client library for AWS Kinesis.

The Golang KCL supports everything needed to write Kinesis stream consumers.  It
offers the same functionality as the official Python KCL:

    http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/speak-to-kinesis-in-python/

This is an unofficial KCL created outside of AWS.


## Current State
The Golang KCL has been tested for basic functionality.  It can consume records,
checkpoint, and handle shard creation and merges.

Feedback and bug reports can be submitted through Github Issues and are greatly
appreciated.


## Quickstart
To build the example:

    cd gokinesis
    export GOPATH=`pwd`
    cd examples/trivial
    go build .

See examples/trivial/README.md for instructions on how to invoke the KCL
MultiLangDaemon on the trivial consumer demo.


## Usage
To write a consumer, implement a struct satisfying the kinesis.RecordConsumer
interface.

1. ``Init(shardId string)`` is called at start.
2. ``ProcessRecords(batch []*KclRecord, cp *Checkpointer)`` is invoked for each
   batch of messages to be processed.
3. ``Shutdown(t ShutdownType, cp *Checkpointer)`` is called at finish.  No
   further calls to the RecordConsumer are made after this.  Implementations
   must check the ShutdownType.  Invoke a checkpoint if it's graceful; do NOT
   checkpoint if it's ZOMBIE.
4. ``ShutdownRequested()`` is called when the KCL has been requested to shutdown
   through a SIGTERM or SIGINT.

If the implementation returns an non-nil error on any of these four methods,
the Golang KCL will exit immediately with a non-zero exit code.

In the Checkpointer, CheckpointAll() marks to the end of the most recently
delivered batch of records.  CheckpointSeq() marks to a specific sequence
number.  Checkpointing returns a non-nil error on conditions which can be
retried.

To begin processing, instantiate the struct and pass it to kinesis.Run().

An example of this is shown in examples/trivial/trivial.go

**Note:** there should be only a single RecordProcessor and invocation of
kinesis.Run().  The MultiLangDaemon protocol uses stdin/stdout to communicate
and does not support multiple consumers in one process.  Instead, it spawns
multiple independent processes which are each assigned a single shard.

**Note:** the KCL MultiLangDaemon uses stdin and stdout to communicate with the
client.  Any consumer output should go elsewhere (e.g. stderr or a file).


## Design
The KCL MultiLangDaemon protocol restricts when checkpointing may happen.
Accordingly, an interface and controller function rather than a Go channel is
used for processing records.
